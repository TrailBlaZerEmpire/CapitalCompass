    <h2>📚 Self-Learning Pillars</h2>
    <p>Alongside structured courses, I build knowledge through books, real-world projects, and a personal growth mindset. I follow my own framework — <strong>6C: Comprehend, Communicate, Collaborate, Creativity, Confidence & Compassion</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Why I Invest in Myself</h2>
    <p>As the founder of TrailBlazer Empire, I believe the best strategy starts with knowledge. I aim to blend practical finance with ethical innovation — and that requires continuous self-learning.</p>
    <p>Credentials matter, but curiosity, discipline, and adaptability matter more. This page is not a resume — it's a reflection of who I'm becoming.</p>
